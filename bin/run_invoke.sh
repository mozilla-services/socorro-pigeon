# Invokes the pigeon lambda function in a python3.6 lambda runtime
# environment. Pass an event in via stdin.
#
# This turns around and uses lambci/lambda:python3.6, so any of those
# args will work, too.
#
# https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda#example
#
# Usage: EVENT | ./bin/run_invoke.sh

# Note: Need to set DOCKER_LAMBDA_USE_STDIN to pipe events from stdin
