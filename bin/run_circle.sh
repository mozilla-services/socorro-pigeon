# Runs flake8 and unit tests in the test container. This is used by
# Circle CI.
#
# Note: Circle CI's Docker can't mount volumes, so we have to run docker
# rather than docker-compose to get around that.
#
# Usage: ./bin/run_circle.sh

docker-compose up -d rabbitmq
docker network ls

# Run flake8
docker run \
    --rm \
    --workdir=/app \
    --env-file=docker/lambda.env \
    socorropigeon_test flake8 /app/build/pigeon.py

# Run pytest
